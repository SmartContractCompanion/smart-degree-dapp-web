# Smart Degree

Smart degree aims to provide a decentralized solution to manage degree. The main idea is for a school, or any entity managing diplomas, to store diplomas validation proof on a blockchain system. Smart Degree currently uses Ethereum as backing blockchain. Once a degree is committed on the blockchain, anyone is able to verify if a degree has been validated by the entity. For example, an employer can verify qualification of a candidate during a job interview.
